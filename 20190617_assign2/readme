I have learned how to use git and the way to build linux virtual machine using AWS from my father. My laptop, the virtual machine, and eelab5 are connected through git.

Using array
-pros: Simple. Only have to manage one array instead of two hash tables. No need to re-set 
      elements when expand array.
-cons: Frequent registration and unregistration of a user item creates many empty elements
      scattered array, which makes linear operations slow.

Using hash table
-pros: Faster linear operations by storing key-value pairs which have same hash function  
      result in the same linked list.
-cons: Need to re-set elements when expand hash table. Need to design reasonable hash 
      function.

I implemented hash table expansion. But a problem arises when unregister users. Especially 221'th user. The other functionalities(:Registering, Getting total sum) operates well. In this reason, when I disable hash table expansion functionality by not adding 
' –D TEST_FEATURE_X ', every functionality works well. Can I get partial points of total extra points of 15?
 
I'd like to be provided more test cases, txt files.

It is impossible because there is no way to calculate array(pcDest) size by parameter. If we enter command like "size_t len=sizeof(pcDest)", the value assigned in len is the size of pointer. 

I used pointer notation in part 1 for extra credit.   

Thank you.
