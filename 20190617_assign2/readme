I have learned how to use git and the way to build linux virtual machine using AWS from my father. My laptop, the virtual machine, and eelab5 are connected through git. Also, I use memset() function which I found in stackoverflow, rather than use for loop to reset buf.
I'd like to be provided more test cases, txt files.

It is impossible because there is no way to calculate array(pcDest) size by parameter. If we enter command like "size_t len=sizeof(pcDest)", the value assigned in len is the size of pointer. 

I used pointer notation in part 1 for extra credit.   

Thank you.
