I have learned how to use git and the way to build linux virtual machine using AWS from my father. My laptop, the virtual machine, and eelab5 are connected through git.

I'd like to be provided more test cases.

BAR_1 and BAR_2 differ only in that their previous states are OUT,IN, respectively. There is a difference in adding the number of words, so I separated them. However, because all the other actions are the same, so I put them together in one circle in the DFA. 

Thank you.
